In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce, deciphering
customer interactions offers a pathway to refine user
engagement and drive strategic growth. This study leverages
network science to dissect a bipartite network of customerproduct
relationships, drawn from a UK-based online retailer. By
examining network centrality and community patterns, alongside
the temporal sway of consumer activities, we reveal how seasonal
trends influence shopping behaviors. A focused comparison
between PageRank and collaborative filtering illuminates the
nuanced role of network topology in shaping recommendation
effectiveness. Our insights advocate for a blended approach,
harnessing both graph-based and traditional techniques to elevate
recommendation systems. This convergence heralds advanced
personalisation strategies, fostering a more intuitive and
consumer-aligned e-commerce environment.
